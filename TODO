copy all relevant tome non-tome-specific code, check engine files, too
	cycle thru all, I guess
finalize the overall storyline, and sketch out the major bits needed (then redo this todo)
	prison->sewer->graveyard->town->worldmap
	town is a dramatic break, very big, opportunity to practice, equip up, swipe stuff
		game adjusts to how much illegal done (wanted, reputation)
	starting quest - get out of the prison
	side quest - take-my-macguffin in the sewers
	side quest - take-up-my sword in the prison, get the key from the secret room
	side quests - collect gold/valuables/treasures, some big ones
	side quest - assassinate
	reputation and faction reactions change the game
	npc chats -> quests and/or reputation / reaction changes, re-emprison (lose equip), etc
	large-scale famous acts (ie steal X's thing)
	overall has to be save the world

Main storyline
	escape from prison: prison->sewer->graveyard->worldmap
	explore a bit: nearby town (Gora) with lots of opportunity
	stuck on static-start doing a few things until can tackle the volcano
