return [[Well, #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#, now you've done it.

You've never had it easy.  You've had to fight for everything your whole life, scraping to get by, barely able to survive.  

Coming to Mount Gora was a no-brainer.  The town is the newest sensation, what with the discovery of that ancient whatever-it-was.  It wasn't the history you cared about, it was all the tourists.  People get excited, merchants start collecting, money starts flowing.  A few coppers or bits of food liberated from the more fortunate wouldn't be missed.

Alas, the Town Guard was eerily efficient.  You have no idea how they found you.  You're definitely not a rookie at this, but find you they did, and dropped you in this damp cell.

That was a few weeks ago, best you can tell.  No sun down here to mark the days.  Fortunately, a hard life begets cunning.  With nothing but time, you've been able to use the materials at hand - rat bones, bits of string from your rags, slime from the walls - to lubricate the hinges and the lock mechanism, and work it open.

There's no way you can make it out the entrance ... but perhaps there's another way out.  You wait for an opportunity, then ease the door open.


Time to go.


And remember to stay ...

In The Shadows.
